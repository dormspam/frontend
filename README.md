## Frontend for dormsp.am

React application that gets data from dormspam/web-backend. To open, first make sure you're running Node 18. Then do:

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` 

The `--legacy-peer-deps` is necessary because we still have some packages (like Materials UI) that depends on Node v16.

Run this command if loading the app for the first time, or whenever new dependencies get added to the application.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
